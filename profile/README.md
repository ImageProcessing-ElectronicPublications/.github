This organization includes cross-platform open source software products for processing scanned document images and creating high-quality printed products based on them.

These software products are not as powerful as Adobe FineReader, but they are enough to a certain extent to create high-quality documents.

The main directions of the organization:
* image thresholding
* segmentation of images into components
* various PDF manipulations
* work with OCR(HOCR)
